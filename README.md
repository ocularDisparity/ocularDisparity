Howdy, this is the main page for OCDP.<br />
Here is some of my code, accumulated through school or self-study. <br />
Currently, I'm working on my Network+, N10-008. <br />
Hopefully I'll have that completed by the end of this summer. I want to get started on my Security+ ASAP and have my trifecta completed. <br />
